Hello, we have designed and created  NFT marketplace, in the backend part we have the smart contracts, the necessary tests to verify that all our software works as we expect.

In the frontend part I worked with React.

The objective with this project was to learn more on my own and take into account the architecture behind building a whole project for the web3 ecosystem.. Strengthen our knowledge about truffle and the powerful tool it is to build, test and implement our projects

I wanted to explore more on ERC721 contracts and their design, to see all the potential and use cases that we can explore with this.(Hope you liked)
